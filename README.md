#### Step 1
To use this code, you will need to install Tampermonkey (if you are using Chrome as your browser). If you already have Tampermonkey, proceed to Step 2.

Tampermonkey: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en

Once Tampermonkey has been installed, an icon should appear in the top right corner of your Chrome browsing window; the icon is a black square with two gray circles on the bottom.

#### Step 2
Left click on the Tampermonkey icon in your Chrome browsing window, and a menu should pop-down from the icon. The menu has two columns of options. In the right column, at the bottom, you will find the "Add a user script..." option. Left click it once, and a new tab will open in your current browsing window.
